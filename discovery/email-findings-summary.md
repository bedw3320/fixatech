## Questions Raised by Email Review

1. **Dev Site Evaluation:**
   - What functionality is already implemented?
   - What can be salvaged vs. rebuilt?
   - Is the hosting (Hostinger) suitable for production?

2. **Figma Design:**
   - Are all required pages designed?
   - What components are included?
   - Mobile responsive designs included?

3. **Sparklayer Integration:**
   - What features were demoed?
   - Pricing/licensing confirmed?
   - Integration complexity assessed?

4. **Budget & Timeline:**
   - What is the overall project budget?
   - What is the desired go-live date?
   - What is the scope for the main project vs. initial small mandate?

---

## Recommendation

Based on email review, I recommend:

1. **Review Current Dev Site:**
   - Audit existing implementation
   - Document what's already built
   - Assess technical debt

2. **Figma Design Review:**
   - Ensure all required pages are designed
   - Validate responsive breakpoints
   - Identify any missing designs

3. **Proposal Preparation:**
   - Clearly define scope boundaries
   - Separate initial mandate work from main project
   - Include Sparklayer licensing/integration costs
   - Factor in ServiCentre integration complexity

4. **Risk Mitigation:**
   - Confirm ServiCentre API capabilities early
   - Test Synergy Sync middleware if possible
   - Establish clear MVP vs. Phase 2 features
   - Set expectations for real-time integration challenges
